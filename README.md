# gorillas-html5

Leveraging Claude to recreate the DOS classic **Gorillas** (QBasic, 1991) as a single-file HTML5 game.

## About

Gorillas is a turn-based artillery game where two gorillas stand atop buildings in a randomly generated city skyline and take turns hurling explosive bananas at each other. Players input an angle and velocity each turn, and the banana arcs across the sky — affected by gravity and wind — until it hits a building (destroying a chunk of it) or strikes the opponent to score a point. First player to reach the target score wins.

## How to Play

Open `gorillas.html` in any modern browser (no server required). Press Enter to start, then:

- **Type a number** to set the angle, press **Tab** to switch to velocity
- Press **Enter** to throw
- Players alternate turns until someone gets hit
- Press **S** on the title screen to configure gravity and points-to-win
